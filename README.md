# neural style transfer using vgg16

Styling the images using a deep cnn for object recognition developed and trained by Oxford's renowned Visual Geometry Group (VGG), which achieved very good performance on the ImageNet dataset.

Style transfer is the technique of recomposing images in the style of other images. It all started when Gatys et al. published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) on how it was actually possible to transfer artistic style from one painting to another picture using convolutional neural networks. Here is an online demonstration given at https://deepdreamgenerator.com/:

This technique to style is not just limited to images, but can also be extended to music, audio and videos.
